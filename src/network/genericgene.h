 * @brief GenericGene provides a base class for all genes
 *
 * The GenericGene class provides a base class for all genes. A gene defines the basic structure
 * of a given network type. A gene is platform-independent.
 *
 * A gene consists of multiple segemnts. Each of the segments has the same size.
 *
 * Other types of genes should inherent this class and m can override all virtual methods. The following methods are mandatory to override:
 *  - identifier()
 *  - _saveGene(QTextStream *stream)
 *  - _loadGene(QList< QList<qint32> > gene qint32 segment_size, QTextStream *stream)
 *  - createGene(QList< QList<qint32> > gene, qint32 segment_size)
 *  - createCopy()
 * Each implementation should also provide the following static methods:
 *  - static GenericGene *loadThisGene(QIODevice *device)

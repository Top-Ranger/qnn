 * \brief The AbstractSimulation class is the base class for all simulations.
 *
 * A simulation is a task which the network has to perform. This task may be performed one time or multiple times.
 * Each simulation should return a score in the range [0,1] describing how well the task was done.
 * All calculation should be done inside the getScore method.
 *
 * A simulation starts in an uninitialised state. The function getScore can only be called after the simulation has be initialised.
 *
 * A subclass of this must overwrite all virtual methods.

QNeuralNetwork
   by Marcus Soll

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QNeuralNetwork (qnn) is a simple to use, customisable and efficient library for
neural network. QNeuralNetwork is written in C++/Qt.

QNeuralNetwork uses an easy internal model. A network is solely defined through
its type, its configuration and its gene. A gene contains a number of segments,
each segment is a list of numbers.

A network can be trained for a task using a genetic algorithm. The task is
contained in a simulation.
